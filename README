connector J2 is a SWD connector.
pinout:
	CON	SIGNAL		LQFP48 pin
	1	NC ?
	2	SWD		31
	3	SCL		30
	4	RST		4
	5	GND

Microprocessor is a LQFP48 package containing a
Nuvoton M0516LDN, ARM Cortex M0
With 64K ROM and 4K RAM

	0000.0000	0000.ffff	FLASH
	2000.0000	2000.0fff	RAM
	6000.0000	6001.ffff	EBI: external memory space (access to Wiznet W5100)
	5001.0000	5001.03ff	EBI: control registers

standard SWDIO tools like the BlackMagicProbe work.
firmware is not protected and can be dumped via gdb:

	(gdb) dump binary memory nuvoton.raw 0 0xffff


important addresses:
0x0000: loaded into SP at reset (0x20000b30, in RAM)
0x0004: loaded into PC at reset (0x00000179, in FLASH)


The flash dump can be disassembled using:

	arm-none-eabi-objdump -D -z -b binary -marm -Mforce-thumb flash.bin

An annotated output is in flash.asm


The Wiznet W5100 ethernet controller is probably connected
to the "EBI" external memory interface of the Cortex M0.
It probably uses a 15-bit address and 8-bit data interface
with some additional control lines. (probably 4-6, to be verified)
the EBI is mapped at 6000.0000 in the Cortex M0.

NOTE: Its also possible that SPI is used...

Wiznet /INT signal is connected to Pin 8 (P3.2, EINT0)

The Wiznet can be used to listen on a specified TCP port,
which seems to be done here. So all lowlevel ethernet/IP/TCP
protocol is done in the Wiznet, which explains that the
firmware of the ARM is so small.
